                <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
                <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1/4 cup dry white wine</li>
                <li>4 eggs</li>
                <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>1 pinch salt and black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
           </ul>
           <h2>Directions:</h2>
           <ol>
                <li>Step: In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook spaghetti pasta until<br> 
                al dente. Drain well. Toss with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and set aside</li><br>
                <li>Step: Meanwhile in a large skillet, cook chopped bacon until slightly<br>
                crisp; remove and drain onto paper towels. Reserve 2 tablespoons of<br>
                bacon fat; add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, and heat in reused<br>
                large skillet. Add chopped onion, and cook over medium heat until<br>
                onion is translucent. Add minced garlic, and cook 1 minute more.<br>
                Add wine if desired; cook one more minute.</li><br>
                <li>Step: Return cooked bacon to pan; add cooked and drained spaghetti<br>
                Toss to coat and heat through, adding more olive oil if it seems dry<br>
                or is sticking togheter. Add beaten eggs and cook, tossing constantly<br>
                with tongs or large fork until eggs are barely set. Quickly add 1/2 cup<br>
                Parmesan cheese, and toss again. Add salt and pepper to taste (remember</br>
                that bacon and Parmesan are very salty)</li><br>
                <li>Step: Serve immediately with chopped parsley sprinkled on top, and extra<br>
                Parmesan cheese at table.</li>
